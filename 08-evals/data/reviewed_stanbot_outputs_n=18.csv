- API endpoints are returning unexpected errors.
- UI elements may need changes to match current and upcoming branding.
- Marketing is planning a rebranding next quarter that could impact design work.","During the standup on 10/07/2024, the team discussed significant issues with the authentication module and API endpoints. UI elements might require updates to align with current branding, and an upcoming marketing rebranding could further impact design work. Due to these challenges, the release planned for 10/11/2024 is at risk, and the team agreed to consider setting a new target date."
5. Long transcript with lots of irrelevant information,"I will create a long standup meeting transcript with at least 8 back-and-forth exchanges among at least 3 people. To make it more challenging, I will include irrelevant information such as discussions about traffic, sports, and office amenities. This will make it harder to extract the key project information.","[info] Standup time: 10/15/2024 09:15:00

Alex: Hey guys, let's get started. How's everyone doing?

Beth: Pretty good, had a crazy commute this morning though. Traffic was terrible.

Carlos: Yeah, tell me about it. I got stuck behind a herd of sheep. No kidding.

Alex: Seriously? That's wild. Anyway, let's jump into updates. Um, so the user authentication module is, uh, moving along. We fixed the major bugs, I think.

Dana: Oh hey, before we get into that, did anyone catch the game last night?

Beth: Oh man, that was insane! Can't believe they pulled off that comeback.

Carlos: Yeah, but I still think they need to improve their defense.

Alex: Guys, can we focus? So, as I was saying, we need to get the authentication feature ready before the October 31st deadline.

Beth: Right, right. So on my end, I'm still working on the UI for the dashboard. I hit a snag with the CSS not rendering properly.

Dana: By the way, does anyone know when the coffee machine is getting fixed?

Carlos: I heard maintenance is coming tomorrow.

Alex: Back to the project, folks. Is the dashboard UI going to be ready by next week?

Beth: Yeah, I think so. Once I get past this issue, it should be smooth sailing.

Dana: Oh, and I almost forgot. The API integration is behind schedule because of the third-party vendor delays.

Alex: That's not good. We need that integration done by October 25th to stay on track.

Carlos: I'll reach out to them again and see if we can expedite.

Beth: So, um, are we going to do anything special for Halloween?

Dana: Maybe we can have a costume contest?

Alex: Let's discuss that after. So, to sum up, we're at risk of missing the October 31st deadline unless we resolve these issues quickly.

Carlos: Got it. I'll focus on the API integration.

Beth: And I'll tackle the UI problem today.

Dana: I'll help where I can, maybe with testing.

Alex: Great, let's reconvene tomorrow. Oh, and about that costume contest...

Beth: Yes!

Carlos: I'm dressing up as a bug in the code.

- Dashboard UI has CSS issues; expected to be resolved soon.
- API integration is behind due to third-party vendor delays; needs completion by October 25th.","The team discussed the progress of the authentication feature, which is scheduled for completion by October 31st. While major bugs have been fixed, there is concern about meeting the deadline. The dashboard UI is experiencing CSS rendering issues, but Beth expects to resolve them soon. The API integration is delayed because of third-party vendor issues, risking the October 25th target. The project is currently at risk, and the team needs to address these problems quickly to meet the deadline."
6. Bad transcript quality,"To create a transcript with bad quality, I'll include background noise indications, inaudible parts, and misheard words. There will be typos, incomplete sentences, and overlapping speech. Despite the poor quality, the key information about the project should still be discernible.","[info] Standup time: 11/05/2024 09:00:00

Alex: Hey guys, sorry for the delay, traffic was... Anyway, let's get started. Uh, who's first?

Jamie: Um, yeah, so I've been working on the, uh, the data migration but ran into that issue with the, you know, the database locks? So I'm kinda stuck until we can get around that.

Sam: Wait, what issue? Sorry, can you... There was some noise, didn't catch that.

Jamie: The database locks, it's, um, it's causing delays in data migration.

Alex: Oh right, that's been a pain. Did you try the, uh, the workaround that, um, what's-his-name suggested?

Jamie: Yeah, but it didn't really, uh, help. Maybe we need to rethink the approach.

[background noise]

Sam: So when is the, when's the deployment supposed to happen again? The 15th?

Alex: Yeah, uh, November fifteenth, but at this rate, might be hard.

Jamie: Unless we fix this, it's going to be tight.

[inaudible voices]

Alex: Okay, um, so the data migration project is at risk? We need to escalate this.

Sam: Yeah, seems like it.

Alex: Alright, let's regroup later today, see what we can do.",Data Migration,11/15/2024,At Risk,"- The data migration is experiencing delays due to database locks.

6. Bad transcript quality,"To simulate bad transcript quality, I included typos, misheard words, incomplete sentences, and missing words in the transcript. This makes it more challenging to extract the required information. The transcript involves three people and includes more than eight exchanges, using casual language and filler words.","[info] Standup time: 10/15/2024 09:03:00

Alice: Hey guys, let's get startd. Um, I've been working on the, uh, the login feautre, and it's... almost done? But ran into some issues with the, you know, the API intgration.

Bob: Oh, yeah, the API, uh, I think there's an update on that, but I'm not totally sure. Did you check the, um, the latest commit from Dave?

Carol: Wait, which API are we talking about? Is it the user authntication or the data fetch one?

Alice: The auth... um, the user auth one. But the docs are kinda out of date, so it's been tricky.

Bob: Right, right. Uh, so for me, I've been debuggin' the data sync problem, but it's still, uh, not working as expectd.

Carol: Yeah, I had similar issues last week. Maybe, uh, we should, like, have a session to go over the, um, the sync logic?

Bob: Yeah, that'd be great. Also, does anyone know when the deadline for the beta releaz is? I thought it was next Monday?

Alice: I think it was, but, uh, it might've been movd? Not sure though.

Carol: I heard it's been pushed to, um, the 25th? But I could be wrong.

Bob: Okay, we should confirm that. Don't wanna miss the date.

6. Bad transcript quality,"To create a test case with bad transcript quality, I included typos, misspellings, and incomplete words to simulate poor transcription. The dialogue reflects casual speech among software engineers with fillers like 'um' and 'uh'. The transcript includes more than 8 back and forth exchanges among three people, and despite the poor quality, key project details are present.","[info] Standup time: 11/05/2024 09:15:00
