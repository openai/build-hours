## Prompt
We will be using the following scenario prompt for today's demo:

"We just received a major shipment of new orders. Please generate a plan that gets the list of awaiting orders and determines the best policy to fulfill them. 

The plan should include checking inventory, ordering necessary components from suppliers, scheduling production runs with available capacity, ordering new components required from suppliers, and arranging shipping to the retailerâ€™s distribution center in Los Angeles. Notify the customer before completing.

Prioritize getting any possible orders out that you can while placing orders for any backlog items."
