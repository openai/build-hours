Instructions:
- Refer to the provided Eval definition, in <eval_task_definition> tags, for the characteristics of the task that we're trying to evaluate.
- Focus on the most difficult test cases that are likely to expose weaknesses in the model. Provide a short explanation for what each test case is evaluating and why it's challenging. Use the values in <examples> to see examples of passing and failing cases.
- You must follow the output format precisely, shown in <output_format> tags, and output valid json.
