# Realtime API

Demo code used in the Realtime API Build Hours.

## Examples

Both examples shown during the build hours were created from scratch or a template – here we are providing the completed version.

We strongly recommend you start new project from scratch or a template, not these examples directly!

### Example 1: Realtime from Scratch

`realtime-from-scratch`: bare-bones example of an audio assistant, built from a fresh NextJS project

To try it yourself from scratch, set up a new [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs) project with:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### Example 2: Long-Running Functions

`openai-realtime-console-example`: example of long-running functions, built on top of the realtime console

To try it yourself from the console, clone the [OpenAI Realtime Console](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console.git
```
